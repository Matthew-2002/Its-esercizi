'''5-1. Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. 
Print a statement
describing each test and your prediction for the results of each 
test. Your code
should look something like this:
car = 'subaru'
print("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
print(car == 'subaru')
print("\nIs car == 'audi'? I predict False.")
print(car == 'audi')
• Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why 
each line
evaluates to True or False.
• Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True 
and another
5 tests evaluate to False.'''
